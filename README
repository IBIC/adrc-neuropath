To copy the skull stripped brain and registrations to the study-specific template to subject directories, run

./00setupsubjects

If skull strip is bad, you will need to remove the edited slice and the slices directory for that subject.

rm -r slices
make slices
(then you edit the slice as before)
Also remove the masks
rm mask*
make mask_to_1mm_bin.nii.gz



If registrations are bad, you just need to remove anything that begins with "mask*"

To regenerate masks

make mask_to_1mm_bin.nii.gz

Once everything is ok, create a new atlas:

./01mergemasks
